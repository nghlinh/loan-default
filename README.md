# Loan Default
## Introduction
Finance is a big sector in automation and digitalization. Currently, many banks are developing or using machine learning and AI to minimize human labor in tasks that can be automated. This report will explore one of the most common applications: Loan defaulters. In loan defaulter, loans are granted automatically to loan that matches the standard, leaving only few to be manually managed.

## Data
The data set is retrieved from [Klagger](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil1e9/loan-default), originally taken from Coursera's Loan Default Prediction Challenge. The data set contains 16 features, 8 of which are used in this project.

## Methodology 
I used various machine learning technique, including Linear Regression and Random Forest Classifier to build a model that predicts whether a loan should be granted. I also performed feature selection to improve the model's performance.

## Result 
The final model achieved an accuracy of 88.4% on the test set for Random Forest Classifier, which is promising for its application.

## Conclusion
My model aim to predict whether an application for loan should be accepted. The model achieved a high level of accuracy and can be further improved with more quality data and advanced techniques.

## Requirements
The code for this project was written in Python 3.8 and requires the following libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage 
To run the code for this project, clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook file.
